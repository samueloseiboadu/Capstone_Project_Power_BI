# Report on U.S.A Police Shootings
## Overview

This report considers police shootings within the context of racism in the United States. This covers in-depth details on variables like gender, race, weapon type, years and cities. This report highlights potential racial biases in law enforcement practices through a series of doughnut charts, column and bar graphs, line graph and tree maps created on data visualization tools.


## Key Questions

1. Why do male suspects make up an overwhelming majority of police shooting incidents compared to females?
2. How do police shooting incidents vary across racial groups in the U.S.?
3. Are police shooting incidents increasing or decreasing over time?
4. What may be the reason for higher numbers of police shootings in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, Las Vegas and San Antonio?
5. Which type of weapon has the highest count in police shooting incidents in the USA over the years?


## Visualization

1. Gender Disparity: Doughnut chart
2. Racial Disparities: Column chart
3. Yearly Trends: Line chart
4. Geographic Distribution: Bar chart
5. Weapon Categories: Treemap


## Key Findings

1. The findings indicate a disparity in gender representation, with 4 673 of the 4 873 incidents that were reviewed being related to men and only 222 to women. This may indicate that encounters with law enforcement are more likely to involve male suspects.
   
2. Among the recorded cases of police shootings, 2,476 involved Whites, 1,298 involved Blacks, 902 involved Hispanics, 93 involved Asians, 78 involved Native Americans, and 48 involved other races. When adjusted for the size of the US population, Black and Hispanic people are disproportionately affected, emphasizing the possibility of racial bias in police interactions.
   
3. There were 965 police shootings in 2015 and 858 in 2019, indicating a modest decline. The large decline to 374 cases in 2020 could be attributed to changes in police tactics, media attention and reports on police activities and people, unrecorded police shooting occurrences, or major economic or political developments such as rallies against police brutality.
 
4. Larger cities, such as Los Angeles (78 cases of police shooting), Phoenix (66 cases), Houston (51 cases), Las Vegas (41 cases), and San Antonio (40 cases), have much more police shootings than smaller cities in the United States. This implies a link between population size and the number of police shootings, and these cities may be recognized for having high crime rates.
   
5. Guns were used in 2,764 police shooting cases, followed by sharp items (818 cases) and unknown objects (418 cases). Guns are dominant because of their widespread ownership in the United States and the perceived threat they pose to law enforcement. Weapons such as hand tools (1 case) and explosives (4) are much less common, most likely because they are easily defendable.


## Conclusion
This report highlights key trends in U.S. police shootings, revealing significant gender and racial disparities. Males are overwhelmingly involved in these incidents, and Black and Hispanic individuals are disproportionately affected compared to their population size. Guns are the most common weapon used, and larger cities see more shootings, and may be linked to higher crime rates. These insights suggest a need to address racial biases and review policing strategies to ensure fair and equitable practices across different communities.

# Report on U.S.A Police Shootings
## Overview

This report considers police shootings within the context of racism in the United States. This covers in-depth details on variables like gender, race, weapon type, years and cities. This report highlights potential racial biases in law enforcement practices through a series of doughnut charts, column and bar graphs, line graph and tree maps created on data visualization tools.


## Key Questions

1. Why do male suspects make up an overwhelming majority of police shooting incidents compared to females?
2. How do police shooting incidents vary across racial groups in the U.S.?
3. Are police shooting incidents increasing or decreasing over time?
4. What may be the reason for higher numbers of police shootings in cities like Los Angeles, Phoenix, Houston, Las Vegas and San Antonio?
5. Which type of weapon has the highest count in police shooting incidents in the USA over the years?


## Visualization

1. Gender Disparity: Doughnut chart
2. Racial Disparities: Column chart
3. Yearly Trends: Line chart
4. Geographic Distribution: Bar chart
5. Weapon Categories: Treemap


## Key Findings

1. Results show that among a total of 4 873 cases examined 4 673 were linked to males while only 222 were tied to females highlighting a difference, in gender representation.. This could suggest that male suspects are more frequently involved in confrontations with law enforcement.
2. Among the recorded cases of police shootings, 2,476 involved White individuals, 1,298 involved Black individuals, 902 involved Hispanics, 93 involved Asians, 78 involved Native Americans, and 48 involved other races. When adjusted for the U.S. population size, Black and Hispanic individuals are disproportionately affected, highlighting potential racial bias in police confrontations.
3. The number of police shootings shows a slight downward trend, with 965 cases in 2015 and 858 in 2019. The significant drop to 374 cases in 2020 may be due to a change in police practices, media attention and reports between police activities and citizens, cases of police shooting incidents not recorded or major economic events or political actions such as protests against police brutality.
4. Larger cities such as Los Angeles (with 78 police shooting cases), Phoenix (66 cases), Houston (51 cases), Las Vegas (41 cases), and San Antonio (40 cases) out of all the cities recorded in the U.S.A, have significantly more police shootings compared to smaller cities. This suggests a correlation between population size and the number of police shooting incidents, and or these cities may be known to be places with hiugh crime rate.
5. Results 2,764 police shooting incidents cases involve the use of guns, followed by sharp objects 818 cases and unknown objects with 418 rooms. Guns dominate due to their widespread ownership in the U.S. and the perceived threat they pose to law enforcement. Weapons like hand tool (1 case) and explosive (4) are far less frequent, likely because one can easily to defend himself against it.

## Conclusion
This report highlights key trends in U.S. police shootings, revealing significant gender and racial disparities. Males are overwhelmingly involved in these incidents, and Black and Hispanic individuals are disproportionately affected compared to their population size. Guns are the most common weapon used, and larger cities see more shootings, and may be linked to higher crime rates. These insights suggest a need to address racial biases and review policing strategies to ensure fair and equitable practices across different communities.
